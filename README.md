# Predict_Apple_stocks_performance__based_on_politicians_sentiment_part1

Look for part two on my other respositories to get the remaining codes.


* Extract data from politico website using scrapy python library
* use pandas and regular expression tools to clean and prepare the data for sentimental analysis
* use sentimental analysis to rate how positive or negative a politicians comment might affect apple stock price performace.
* use matplotlib to display my result graphically.
